# Case Study 1 - A/B Testing New Advertising System
Business Problem:
* A social media site is currently using a bidding system called: 'maximum bidding.' They would like to test how the new system 'average bidding' will impact overall product purchases through the advertisements.

Recommendation:
* The difference in purchases from the new bidding system was not statistically significant. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that the higher yield in purchases in the new system were due to the system itself or other spurious variables. The current bidding system distribution has slightly lower minimum and maximum values, but the standard deviation is lower making purchases through advertisements less varied.

# Case Study 2 - Random Forest Classifier for HR churn and employee satisifaction
Business Problem: 
* HR has noticed more employees leaving the company. They sent out surveys to better understand potential reasons. How can we help to alleviate employee churn and improve employee satisfaction?

Recommendation: 
* Key findings include reducing projects to below 5 for each employee. Also reducing average monthly hours to below 250.

# Case Study 3 - Multivariate Regression for Penguins species
Business Problem: 
* A company researching penguins would like to know if species of penguin changes with the size and weight of penguins.

Results:
* The average penguin will weigh 30g more for every penguins 1mm bill length.
* Male penguins also weighed 541g more than the average female penguin.
* Additionally, chinstraps weighed 277g less than Adelie penguins, and Gentoo penguins weighed 1100g more than Adelie penguins

# Case Study 4 - Predictive Coffee Sales in New York
Business Problem: 
* A coffee chain in New York has store locations in 3 main areas of New York. They would like to know how to improve coffee sales.

Recommendation: 
* Transactions had the strongest predictor of sales. Particularly, purchases of 4 or more strongly impacted sales. 
* Coffee beans was also a strong predictor of sales, considering it consisted of most high profit outliers.
* Time of purchase across month, weekday, or hour of day were not strong predictors of sales.
* Next steps would include reviewing product categories for branded, coffee beans, and coffee flavours added. Additionally, grouping epoch time of purchase to identify customers who bought multiple purchases in a single transaction.
